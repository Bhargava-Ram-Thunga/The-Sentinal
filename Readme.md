# The Sentinel: Integrity. Verified.

## Project Overview

Every successful operation starts with a simple rule: **no room for error**.  
The Sentinel is built on that principle. This isn't your average attendance solution; it's a strategically engineered, **anti-spoofing attendance system**. It stands as a definitive verdict on who is present and who isn't.

By leveraging a meticulously crafted **facial recognition model** and **liveness detection**, we ensure that every record is beyond reproach, eliminating fraud with surgical precision.

This is a **complete, full-stack solution**. The backend is a fortress, and the frontend is an executive dashboard‚Äîclean, intuitive, and built for people who value their time.

Unlike a simple login form that can be defeated with a stolen password or a static photo, this system demands **genuine presence**. It‚Äôs designed for environments where accountability is paramount and cutting corners is not an option.

The Sentinel doesn't make assumptions; **it verifies**. This is not about trusting your employees; it‚Äôs about providing them with a system they can trust, and that, in turn, allows management to act with unshakable confidence.

## Key Features üîê

### **Verifiable Presence**

The core of the system is the integration of **DeepFace** and **RetinaFace**. We don't just recognize a face; we verify a living person.  
A photograph or a screen recording won't cut it.

- **Multi-frame capture sequence** + **anti-spoofing logic** = digital lie detector.
- Detects subtle variations only a live person can produce.
- Guarantees the presented face belongs to a real individual.

This is the difference between a system that works and one that is just for show.

### **Executive Access**

The dedicated **admin dashboard** is a **command center**.  
It provides a **real-time, unfiltered view of attendance records**, allowing for quick decisions and comprehensive oversight.

From this single interface, administrators can:

- Pull **daily attendance logs**.
- Review **historical records**.
- Identify **patterns of presence/absence**.

This isn't just **data**; it's **actionable intelligence**.

### **Bulletproof Security**

Your data is protected by **military-grade security**.

- **Passwords** are one-way hashed with **bcrypt**.
- **JWT tokens** handle sessions statelessly.

‚û°Ô∏è Even if breached, no one can access original passwords.  
‚û°Ô∏è JWT tokens are clean, expirable keys.

It‚Äôs a **secure, efficient** way to do business.

### **Seamless User Experience**

Frontend is built with **React** for speed and simplicity.

- **react-hot-toast** ‚Üí immediate feedback.
- **react-router-dom** ‚Üí smooth navigation.
- **react-webcam** ‚Üí direct camera feed integration.

The flow: **log in ‚Üí capture face ‚Üí done.**  
No unnecessary clicks. No wasted time.

---

### **Historical Data Integrity**

Attendance records are logged in **MongoDB**.

- Flexible **NoSQL structure**.
- Fast queries.
- Evolves with your needs.

Every check-in becomes a **permanent record**‚Äîready whenever you need it.
